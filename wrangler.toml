# Cloudflare Pages configuration
#
# Note: Build command and caching must be configured in the Cloudflare Pages UI:
# - Build command: bash scripts/build.sh
# - Build cache: Enable "Build cache (beta)" in Settings > Builds & deployments
#
# The npm indirection in scripts/build.sh is required because Cloudflare only caches
# specific package manager directories (.npm/, .cache/yarn, etc), not custom dirs.
